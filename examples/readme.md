# Examples

The use of ```pheflux.py``` is exemplified in the following files:

- example.ipynb: Example run of ```pheflux.py``` using Jupyter notebook.
- example.sh: Example run of ```pheflux.py``` using Linux bash script. It calls the ```pheflux-terminal.py``` file. 

Both examples use the information stored in the ```data``` folder, and save the outputs in the ```results``` folder.
